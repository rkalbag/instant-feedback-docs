## Instant Feedback Configuration Steps

The following are the main steps to setup the application:
1. [Creating a public website using Salesforce Sites](https://rkalbag.github.io/instant-feedback-docs/#/./configure/Create%20A%20New%20Salesforce%20Site)

	The public website is needed to collect feedback and is the destination of the Instant Feedback web links.
1. [Enable Apex Class Access for Site](https://rkalbag.github.io/instant-feedback-docs/#/./configure/Enable%20Apex%20Class%20Access%20For%20Site)

	The newly created Site above needs permissions to run the Application code that stores the collected information in Salesforce. This is done by enabling the Site to access certain Apex Classes.
1. [Provide Object Permissions to Site](https://rkalbag.github.io/instant-feedback-docs/#/./configure/Provide%20Object%20Permissions%20to%20Site)

	The newly created Site above needs permissions to Read some Standard Object and Create records in the application's Custom Objects.
