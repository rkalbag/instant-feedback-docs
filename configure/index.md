## Instant Feedback Configuration Steps

The following are the main steps to setup the application:
1. Creating a public website using Salesforce Sites. The public website is needed to collect feedback and is the destination of the Instant Feedback web links. Instrucitons for setup are shown [here](https://rkalbag.github.io/instant-feedback-docs/#/./configure/Create%20A%20New%20Salesforce%20Site)
1.The newly created Site above needs permissions to run the Applicaiton code that stores the collected information in Salesforce. This is done by enabling the Site to access certain Apex Classes as shown [here](https://rkalbag.github.io/instant-feedback-docs/#/./configure/Enable%20Apex%20Class%20Access%20For%20Site)
