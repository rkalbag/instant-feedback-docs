# Automate

The Instant Feedback application has already set up a Flow called 'Instant Feedback: poor feedback manager alert' to generate a task for the User's Manager that receives a poor feedback rating.

You can similarly automate events based on the creation of records. For example, automate an email to the reviewer to thank them for their feedback. That email can also contain contact information to escalate or to notify if they did not provide the review.
