This means that each of your support or sales team memeber can have a unique link to receive feedback from colleagues, customers or anyone they share the link with. The link can be shared in chat instant messaging conversations with customers or in email signatures. The feedback is collected using a Salesforce Site and is linked appropriately.

Managers can see how their team is performing, get alerts on poor feedback, and run reports.
