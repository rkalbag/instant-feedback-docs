# Use

Once each User gets their [Instant Feedback link](https://youtu.be/MNMbtNCQFm4) by visiting the Instant Feedback tab or from the Salesforce Administrator, they can use it in every interaction with their customers. 

They can add it to their email signature, send it during online chat interactions, and even add it to the support ticket responses.

When the recepient of the Instant Feedback link clicks on it, they provide feedback by filling a form as shown in the video below.
